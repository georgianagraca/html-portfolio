  and an artist passionate and the gallery below showcase samples of projects further developed in the pages of this 
  portfolio.</p>

<p>I am Georgiana Maria, and I am a second-year Computer Science student at the Federal University of Paraíba. 
  I am from João Pessoa, Brazil, and this website is a little window into what I have learned, done, and created 
  during my first few years in college while pursuing my degree. On the professional side, I have included the main 
  projects I have been a part of through classes, internships, and clubs on campus.</p>

<p>I have also been involved with art for many years, exploring different dance styles and acting techniques. 
  These are my main hobbies since I was a kid, and I have included some of my favorite works. I believe that creating 
  and maintaining an analytical perspective on my art while learning from it makes me a better professional, as it ties 
  into concepts of creativity in general, and vice versa.</p>
